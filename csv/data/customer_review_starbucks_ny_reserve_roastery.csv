"2024-01-08","Un sueño absoluto para los amantes del café!","Situado al lado del mercado de Chelsea, a un costado de la tienda Apple.

Un local de 2mil metros cuadrados, tres plantas, color niquel, óxido y negro con diseño tipo industrial, en cuyo centro se encuentra un gigantesco molino de cafe. 

Dos cafeterías grandes y una panadería completan las opciones de comida y bebida. 

Ademas de una extensa y bien distribuida area de venta de tazas, termos y otros articulos.

El servicio es amable y a pesar de estar increiblmente lleno, fue rapido.  

Ademas de las bebidas frias o calientes, hay excelentes opciones de comida y postres.

El sfilatino de mortadela con pistachos esta riqusimo y el cheescake de frambuesa es una delica total!

Lo recomiendo absolutamente.","5"

Terrible experience. she demanded that we wait in the long queue again even though we had already done so just because she is an arrogant woman","1"
"2023-12-09","Large Starbucks ","The place is cool and has a lot more options then a regular Starbucks. But there really isn't enough seating in there. The merch is different then a typical Starbucks. Your can purchase things with the Starbucks app but you can not redeem Starbucks rewards here. ","4"
"2023-12-05","The Nicer Starbucks...With The Higher Price Tags","Manhattan has coffee shops every few blocks, but you'll never go wrong with stepping in a Starbucks Reserve. The menu at this location is more expansive(and more expensive), and since we came in November, they had the Christmas-themed drinks on their own separate menu. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that it was so busy we had to wait for a tabletop to open up. And it's a two level shop & roastery. They gave great service though, and offered bagged coffee for purchase from regions we didn't see offered in other Starbucks Reserve locations, even in Seattle. I had the espresso martini and the barrel-aged Oleato cold brew. My wife had the cold brew flight. We both enjoyed them. I also tried the brownie, and it was really good. My wife disnt enjoy here truffle flatbread though. Check it out if you're roaming around Manhattan.","4"
"2023-12-04","RUDE host in the cocktail area. AWFUL","After staying with family I wanted to visit here before I flew home. I was on my own. I wanted a cocktail so had gone upstairs. Don't know his name but the most aggressive and RUDE host/person I have ever met. And I'm a high school teacher from Scotland :) 

Our exchanges before I told him he needs a new job and shouldn't be allowed anywhere near the public: 

*I asked for a plug point as my iPhone 8 was low. He patronisingly told me that if I want a cafe like that to go elsewhere.  He walked away. 

*I asked for a menu but he told me it was a QR Code. And walked away. He was then equally rude to others that arrived. 

*I ordered an espresso cocktail and put my coat down at a table. He shouts from the bar - ""You're not sitting there and taking up all my tables. You're one person. Sit at the bar"". I was shocked. Tempted to leave but didn't. 

*I sit at the bar and a couple walk in, who are also told rudely they've to sit at the bar. I notice my seat has two together. Nowhere else did. I told them they can have my seat and I'll move to the end of the bar. I also didn't want to look at the host. 

I sit down at the end of the bar. He then shouts and gestures to me from quite a distance, ""What are you doing. Are you for real. Do you even want a drink!?"". No way.
 
At this point I said, ""You drink them and maybe look for a new job. Your attitude is horrendous. You are ruining people's experience."" He told me to walk on and get out. I asked him why he was in this job. He didn't look at me again. I then walked out. A few smiles from others sitting.

I was pretty shaken up, reported it to the manager downstairs. He was lovely and I did get my drinks and a complimentary cake but sat downstairs. I also met some lovely people next to me.  Reading some of the reviews, a crash course in customer service is required. 

A Scottish lass is a good match for a New Yorker....","1"
"2023-12-01","Not the best experience","Expensive and not clean. Service was below what I expected from a Starbucks reserved. I much prefer the Starbucks Reserve in Milan.","2"
"2023-11-22","Terrible customer service. Staff too 'cool for school' to even smile and say thanks!!","Been here the last time we were in NYC and weren't we in for a shock! Lovely cake and drinks, but the customer experience is shocking! Apart from one person who served me, everyone else behind the counter we spoke to were so rude. 
The lady who was calling out names barely engaged, just said; 'put the pager in the basket"". No please,  no thank you at all. I asked if I could have ice for our water and she ignored me, but must have said something to a colleague as I had ice in a cup put in front of me,  again with no comment or even a smile. 
We'd asked for water from two staff before and they just pointed to a counter and said; ""water's there"". 
I never normally write Trip Advisor reviews, but this 'so cool for school' behaviour of employees has incensed me! If you hate where you work, move on, no one is forcing you to do something you don't want to do. Let others with manners and at least a smile replace you!","3"

"2023-11-04","お土産探しに行くのもあり","Googleの斜め前、道を挟んでチェルシーマーケットの隣にあります。クリストファーから歩いて来て疲れたので休憩に入ってみました。建物は普通ですが、中は思ったよりずっと広くてきれい。焙煎エリア、バー、カフェ、パンやケーキピザ、お土産コーナーなど、どこもとても混んでいて、オーダーは並んで待っている間にQRコードでメニューが見られます。夕飯を食べる前というタイミングでしたが、ブリオッシュにプロシュートハムが挟んであるパンを１つ頼んでみたら、とても美味しかったです。それにコーヒーとソイラテを添えて日本円で4000円を超えてしまうのは、円安と物価高のニューヨークでは致し方なく、円換算せずに楽しみたいところ。
　お土産コーナーにNew York と書かれたアーチがあり、そこで記念写真を撮っている人もいました。地下にあるトイレもきれいなので、チェルシーマーケットに行かれるなら、カフェタイムはここですると良いと思います。","4"
"2023-10-24","Uno de los locales más lindos de Starbucks","Fuimos a conocer el primer local Starbucks reserve y nos encantó. Podemos ver cómo funcionan las máquinas tostadoras, tomar cafe y probar la pastelería que es más gourmet que en las sucursales tradicionales.
Tienen su propia línea de merchandising. La atención normal y los precios correctos.","4"

"2023-09-26","When you put all the money in the build-out, and forget completely about client experience!","This place os a disaster! Look is great and the location can’t be better but it takes forever to have simple things (20minutes for an expresso!!!), and the staff behave like jerks, kind of « I’m too cool for you, you cannot understand ». 
On top, most of Starbucks regular drinks are not offered here (probably the Chai is not hype enough?).
What a disappointment!","1"
"2023-09-23","Amazing gourmet Starbucks under the Empire State ","This is a gorgeous gourmet Starbucks at the ground floor of the Empire State building. They have a basement level with dining tables and they also serve alcohol.
Starbucks gourmet coffees, gorgeous sandwiches all baked in house.
Great place to stop if you are near the Empire State. I would go here every day if I could. Just love this place. Beautiful ambiance. Great for a date or with a big family.","5"
"2023-09-13","Péssimo atendimento e experiência.","Atendimento péssimo. Funcionários mal educados. Serviram errado, depois a bebida veio fria por ter ficado largada em cima de um balcão.
Não serviram na xícara pois alegaram que não queriam lavar louça.
Fui duas vezes, para ver se não tinha dado azar.
Mas em ambas as visitas a experiência foi horrível.
A proposta do lugar é legal, porém o atendimento e o serviço são lamentáveis.
A nota é 1 por não ter uma nota mais baixa.","1"
"2023-09-03","Amazing! Loved it but not the dogs’s flees inside","😊The experience is amazing.  The bakery staff is fantastic! I wish I’d asked for the name of the African American young baker who gave me amazing service.  One can tell this is not a job for her, it’s her passion! The baked goods are amazing!!! Try the raisin and pistachio swirl roll (like a cinnamon roll or pain au raisin) food and coffee are 10 out if 10

🙁The only downside is that customers bring their dogs in and some have flees.   I had lots of flee bites which stopped when I sprayed my legs with sanitizer. I wish dogs were not allowed.  But it seems almost all cafes allow dogs inside.","4"
"2023-08-26","Tanto fumo e poco arrosto","Il posto è bellissimo quasi come quello di milano ma il caffè arriva freddo senza cucchiaino e l’acqua te la servono in bicchierino di plastica mollicci. In più se la tirano come se fosse un 3 stelle. Tutta la vita la colombe recensita ieri!","2"
"2023-08-11","Impolite Staff","I was waiting for about more than 20 minutes, even at the time I ordered, only two other persons were there. I asked once, when I will get my Coffee, but nothing happens. Because I had to reach my train, I asked a second time and at this moment the staff were shouting at me…….
It was at Starbucks at Pennstation in NYC.","1"

"2023-07-22","Good coffee at Starbucks, who'd have thought?!","After the empire state building we wanted a coffee so stopped in. The downstairs isf rankly confusing as it's not a shop and not a Starbucks. I think it's a boutique and I think it sells drinks but I can't be sure.

Upstairs is a cafe/restaurant and very nice it is too. It isn't the standard overly milky coffee either but will sourced beans brewed and served as coffee. The food is good too. None of it is cheap though.

I had a cold brew flight including a bourbon matured coffee ($30 for 300g was too expensive even for me). The olive oil latte my wife had was nice too with the olive oil adding a creaminess to the drink.

Overall with the experience of you have the money. And like coffee.","5"

"2023-07-01","Excellent coffee but don’t buy special reserve beans","We sat by the bar to order drinks. My husband ordered the affogato with whisky barrel reserved cold brew and it was excellent! We also got a complementary appetizer item, which was yummy! We bought the special reserve whisky barrel beans which was very expensive and when I opened it, I realized it’s half filled and it cost $42! We were extremely disappointed with this purchase!","3"
"2023-06-20","Druk, maar mooie locatie.","Leuk om binnen te stappen. Giga druk, maar na een paar keer rondlopen konden we een tafeltje bemachtigen. Daarna moet je in de rij gaan staan om te bestellen. Je krijgt een buzzer mee waarmee je vervolgens je drankjes weer kan ophalen. Twee latte machiattos daar drinken kost je $18. We kregen deze in grote ronde mokken. Vraag specifiek om “klein” als je dat wil aangezien ze standaard “groot” serveren. Wel lekker natuurlijk. To go is ook mogelijk, maar dat kan je beter bij een andere Starbucks doen vanwege de drukte.","4"
"2023-06-06","Amazing food","This is my favorite Starbucks.

It also has a lot of space.

"2023-05-29","Disappointment","After visiting Milano Roadstery it was a huge disappointment. NY looks like a poor copy of Milano. Less variety of coffee, smaller venue and machines do not look that impressive.
We tried a few coffees, and nothing special - only Arabica blends. I was expecting an experience, but I just got not that tasty coffee.
There are many areas to improve - coffee variety (not only Arabica blends!), bar tender skills (they could mix the coffee drinks instead of just putting stuff together), line management (people got confused about what you can order on each level).
The store is fine.","3"

"2023-05-21","Check In the Box","Over rated. I was determined to go but they were rude. They also do not enough sitting and no charging stations. To charge my phone I was told to go a different Starbucks. They had a nice sample. It was a whiskey cold brew coffee. They had a lot of over priced food. The merchandise section was a little overwhelming. Starbucks is a lifestyle here. It was different and a check in the box. I got a little espresso cup to prove it. Lol","3"
"2023-05-12","Disappointing and Chaotic Experience at Starbucks Reserve Roastery","I recently visited the Starbucks Reserve Roastery, excited to try their unique offerings, but I was left disappointed by the disorganized, frustrating, and overpriced experience. I ordered multiple items, which meant I had to retrieve them from various locations throughout the roastery. This process was chaotic, and no one had informed me that I would have to wait for multiple buzzes from a single pager. It felt more like a scavenger hunt than a relaxing coffee experience.

The situation was further exacerbated when my lemonade went missing. After waiting for quite some time, I realized that someone must have taken it. I had to approach the staff to explain the situation and request that they make another one for me. They did, but this only added to the overall inconvenience and cost of my visit.

The disorganization, lack of communication, and exorbitant prices during my visit made it a stressful and unsatisfactory experience. I can only give it 2 stars out of 5, and I hope they take steps to improve their customer service, streamline their processes, and reassess their pricing for a better experience in the future.

Not coming back to check the improvement though","2"
"2023-05-12","Unique experience at Starbucks Reserve Roastery ","One of its kind ""Starbucks Reserve Roastry"" cafe across the world. The interior decor and outdoor building structure are unique. It is lovely idea to combine many products in one Starbucks shop like pizzeria, pastries, sandwiches, drinks, coffee roaster and bar. It is also clean and have good vibes. It is located in front of Chelsea Market at 9th Avenue. Highly recommended place","5"

"2023-04-16","Worth a visit even for a sceptic!","I’m definitely more a fan of the artisanal hipster brew than the mass produced fare Starbucks makes and as much as I thought this was a total tourist trap, it was still worth popping into for the experience","4"

"2023-02-24","Not what it used to be","I visited Starbucks Reserve in NYC a few years ago and used to love it, even when the service wasn’t ever quick, the quality of the products and the service was outstanding. It used to be the best coffee I’ve ever had in Manhattan. This time (feb 2023) not only was the quality bad (flat white wasn’t flat white but milk with a little bit of coffee, and cheesecake felt artificial), but when I approached the barista and told him gently that my coffee wasn’t what I was expected, he didn’t even try to fix it, and just gave me a vague excuse. There was no manager or anyone in charge around, noone asked why we left our cups almost untouched. The whole experience I had was not worth $7.5 per coffee or $11 for the cheesecake. Place is really beautiful, though.","1"
"2023-02-03","Visita imperdible","El lugar es alucinante, para hacer un viaje en el tiempo. Alejado totalmente de la estética típica de estos locales. Sin lugar a dudas, amerita una para en el recorrido por la zona de Chelsea, y de ser posible un cafecito con algo rico para acompañar","4"
"2023-01-24","Well worth a visit","A great alternative trip to a coffee shop. So interesting to see the roasting process and there is a great chance to buy coffee beans.","5"
"2022-12-31","You must improve","The idea is fantastic. The style can be improved. 
1. Do not bring a coffee as an offer from Starbucks. It is bot requested and the quality was not good.
2. Sugar. You want to have style and you do not leave sugar sachet on the table. Fine you mist bring the sugar with the tea or the coffee. The choice should comprise white sugar, bot only cane or dextrose. For your information white sugar is simply purified sugar that eliminate the contaminants. Guess what is going to happen if I analysed  cane sugar…
3. When you bring a brioche you must bring the brioche with a white paper.
4. The brioche should come with the coffee.","1"
"2022-12-22","Starbucks Reserve","아침 오픈전부터 입구에 손님들이 기다릴 정도 입니다. 하지만 오전에 일찍 방문한다면 워낙 넓어서 문제 될 거 없습니다. 여기서 로스팅한 빈이나 굿즈도 다양하게 판매하니 한번쯤 들려보셔도 좋을듯 하네요.","4"
"2022-11-27","Disgusting host","The most disgusting and entitled so called “host” and human being called Robert. Came straight up to me in my face to argue with my choice of moving seats due to a back pain. Shouting when all he needed was some manners. So shocked at his lack of service we instantly left. Shame that out of all the lovely New Yorkers we met on this trip, this was the last one we encounter before flying home.","1"
"2022-10-19","Not the Starbucks you expect so prepare yourself.","First of all, this is not a Starbucks like you would expect so wipe out your expectations and start over.  

This is a beautiful restaurant  that features fancy coffees and other high end sandwich and breakfast items.  There’s a greeter like Walmart welcoming you into the beautiful space.  There are coffee beans flying in plastic tubes overhead and coffee roasters all over.  There’s a bar with real drinks on the upper level.  Wasn’t open yet so can report on the quality of the mixologists or cocktails.  There are seating areas all over the place and a good location just across the street from Google NYC. 

Here’s what its not:
	-  there are no plugs available for guests.  All are covered up.  I was told that the sophisticated roasters require power that could fry a laptop plugin so to protect our computer gear, no plugs….anywhere.   Clearly what they are saying is that they do not want this venue to be anyone’s home office for a day so move on!
	-everything is more expensive  - i mean MORE expensive - than your local Starbucks so prepare to pay lots more for the glorious experience of the Rotisserie.   
	- expect long lines to place your orders.  The menu is more complex than your ordinary store and the service is slow.  Lots of theater in the process of ordering, preparing and completing your order but it just adds to the stress not to the warm expectation of a great beverage.
	-  your mobile app can work for payment but not for mobile ordering.   “We don’t do that here.”  Our bill exceeded what was on my card.  When advised, I asked about my auto reload and was told that “ sorry the reload feature does not work in this store.”  What??
	- the music can be very loud.  When I got an important call, I couldn’t find a quiet spot.  I huddled in the doorway entrance between the doors.  An employee came out and advised me that guests were not supposed to stand between the doors. “Go inside or out, not here!”
	- Bottom line, way too much time spent telling us why this is NOT the Starbucks you are used to in an effort to be way too special.  

So buyer beware.  It’s pretty and feels luxurious but its not the Starbucks you’ve come to know and maybe love.  Fancy yes, but not what I was looking for.   I’ll move a few blocks away and get back to the normal $6 cup of coffee!  Howard, save us from all this!","1"

"2022-09-29","For die hard Starbucks fans...","Truth be told, there are places -even nearby places- with better coffee, better food, and better service. Contrary to the traditional Starbucks store friendly attitude, baristas at this roastery behave way too condescendingly. 

On the bright side, I do acknowledge the place is VERY comfortable because it is VERY spacious and wonderfully wheelchair friendly. Not many coffee shops -and neither restaurants- can afford such a huge space. And if the menu is browsed carefully, one or two really outstanding beverages might pop up.","3"

Dopo circa 45’ di coda la cassa si è bloccata e abbiamo dovuto spostarci su un altra cassa. Dopo aver fatto l’ordine ci sono voluti altri 10’ per farsi consegnare un panino. Personale molto lento e disorganizzato, piuttosto disinteressato ai clienti. Musica troppo alta. Esperienza decisamente negativa.
Il cibo buono, soprattutto la pizza, ma l’attesa estenuante e il caos della gestione ci fanno sconsigliare questa scelta.","1"

"2022-08-04","Fantastic cocktails in a fascinating setting","What a fab place. Obviously it’s Starbucks, but it’s not what you’d expect. We went to the Arriviamo cocktail bar and tried a few of the the items on the menu. I loved their take on an Old Fashioned and I also had a classic Espresso Martini. Not cheap - $100 for four cocktails, but worth it for a treat. Also there are three levels with a shop, a coffee bar, a sandwich bar and a roastery. With a visit.","5"
"2022-08-02","Amazing Starbucks Flagship","This should be in every major city in the country.

My first visit I attempted to buy coffee, waited 30 mins in line and decided to leave… crazy lines, I’m guessing their clueless for providing service!
My 2nd attempt was showcasing this location to friends from Florida. Again a line up, shorter, this time only 15 mins.
I placed an order for a black coffee and frappicino; 20 minutes later I approach the clerk whom I ordered the drinks and enquired about my order. So sorry Sir, my misplaced it in the que, will get to it now! I asked why the coffee was $7, she replied we make it fresh for you… 35 minute wait when it’s hot and humid outside and the inside feels the same way! I couldn’t finish my coffee, it was so bitter, strong and pungent… horrible. My friend suggested I add sugar, I drink coffee black for a purpose, to enjoy the flavor. Stay away, awful service, outrageously expensive and the experience was F…. Flawed!!! Stick to your stand alone stores StarGuck!","1"

"2022-07-06","VISITA AGRADABLE","Durante nuestra estancia en NY teníamos apuntado visitar este Starbucks tan nombrado por algunos blogs, y la verdad que no nos decepcionó.

En comparación con los otros locales de la marca y de la zona (donde el café no valía nada), de este nos llevamos un buen sabor de boca. Los dos cafés que probamos estaban muy buenos, se nota que lo hacen con mimo. 

El local es enorme. Tiene zonas con mesas y sillas por todas partes y se está a gusto. La gracia del local, aparte de la variedad de cafés que no encuentras en otras cafeterías de la marca, es la historia que te cuentan. Simulan o muestran con detalle la preparación del mismo.

Si estás por la zona es aconsejable hacer un descansito y tomar uno de sus cafés sí o sí!","5"

Frøydis and David from Denmark","5"
"2022-05-19","Must Try!","My gf and I had this on our list to visit while in NYC. I highly recommend folks try at least a cocktail. Although it can be a bit more pricey, it is the experience. This place was packed in the afternoon. I recommend trying one of their flights they have since you will get to try 3 of their cocktail drinks. I am not a coffee and liquor combination person but these drinks were amazing! They sure know what they are doing. Highly recommend, smaller parties is ideal, larger parties of more than 4 may find it difficult for seating.","5"
"2022-05-07","Great experience","This place is a whole experience!  Fancy Starbucks, restaurant, fresh coffee grinding area and bakery area combined.  Really neat. Caution- they do not have typical Starbucks frozen drinks (ie Frappuccino). The employee though was super friendly and helpful to find a drink to sub for my 15 year old’s fave Frappuccino.  We had a very cool thing happen as we were sitting and drinking our drinks- a man came over and recited a Mother’s Day poem for me. Not sure if he was employed by Starbucks or just some random guy but it was cool. This is right across from Chelsea Market which is also a great place to visit.","5"

This location is not like your typical in and out Starbuck stores. When you are here, you can see how they roast beans, how they prepare your coffee as well as a part of the store that focuses on alcoholic coffee drinks too.

I ended up getting an iced mocha, which was very good. Our friends got 2 flights of different coffees, which they thoroughly enjoyed drinking! You can easily spend a couple of hours here for a pick me up!

They have a lof ot things that normally you cant eat in a regular Starbucks and the most special part is the bar where you can get a cocktail🍹, really? YES. With coffee or traditional, but dont be boring and try a Espresso Martini or something differet (price average $ 22).  If you buy a Souvenir, comment which one you get. 

I would to tell you more but I m in another place that is amazing too, the food is delicious and you can see on my Instagram @elmanudominguez ✌

"2022-01-30","A very good Double Espresso indeed!","I love a freshly-brewed coffee, and either brew one myself in my trusted Bialetti, or buy a barista-style double espresso from on my favourite coffee shops, on a daily basis.  Starbucks has never featured in this daily routine.   I have, however, been curious about the much-touted Starbucks Reserve thing.  It’s often talked about  as if it’s  a bit of a special club, a place for those who like to think they are coffee snobs and need something more exclusive than a humble latte to get them through the morning.  So when we passed one as we were exploring the Meatpacking District on a recent visit to New York, we paid a visit to sample for ourselves.  The long queue for entry spoke volumes. 

To explain it simply,  the difference between the regular Starbucks branch that you find everywhere and a Reserve store is this, the Reserve stores use more rare  and small-lot coffee beans that  are roasted in the setting and then brewed by baristas through different techniques like Chemex, Pour-over, Siphon, and so on. The featured coffee beans are usually only available for a limited time, so what you get at Starbucks Reserve is fairly exclusive and differs with each visit. 

It was like entering a chemistry laboratory1.   There were copper funnels, glass siphons and bottles, curious still-like furnaces and pipes everywhere.  Had it not been for the myriad of keepsakes, souvenirs and coffee-related items on sale, you would have thought you were in some kind of exclusive laboratory.  Mugs, sweatshirts, aprons and such paraphernalia in great abundance really sets the commercial scene here.

But it was about the coffee.  There’s a coffee bar of course, selling a zillion varieties and styles of coffee, along with patisseries and more substantial food items.  Ordering was a bit like being subject to an intense interrogation to determine exactly your coffee required so it could be prepared exclusively for you.  It was all a bit of fun, really. 

And the verdict?  My Double Espresso was outstanding.  My companion's Flat White was also outstanding.  Yes, outstanding! And at a price, of course.  I’d certainly have it again. 

The roastery is certainly worth a visit!  Yes, it's  a bit gimmicky, but you should get a good coffee!","4"

It was overwhelming and exciting.  The diverse staff was very hip because of their clothing.  There is a high end bar. No cheap well drinks.  There was a bread bakery.  You can watch them roast coffees.  On the way to the unisex bathroom you will pass actual coffee plants.  

The merchandise is tempting to buy.  Really cool stuff - that you don't need - you don't.

The COVID protocols were well thought out.

What makes this place so special is the table service outside.  A Starbucks with wait staff!  It was a fun treat after completely the HIGHLINE.","4"

"2021-06-19","It's really too bad not all starbucks are like this.","A bit pricey, but a high quality espresso bar with excellent food. It's not currently fully-open, but the staff was able to replicate the pre-covid experience as best they could.","5"
"2021-06-14","Disappointing in so many ways","I am a long time admirer of Starbucks as a place to relax, meet friends, and surf the web, I almost feel guilty to make a really negative review of a Starbucks... but here goes!  It was not a good experience at all. The Roastery was disappointing on so many different levels...uncomfortable, and a poor and disorganized venue. I suggest just to avoid it and go elsewhere. 

While part of the problems are Covid related distancing and occupancy situations that may improve later, there was so much else wrong that I cannot be  forgiving.  With lower occupancy and less customers, you would think service could be better...not worse.

Let me list the non pandemic related issues first:

1. Different items are located in different areas, and there are many different long lines of customers for each of these areas. The venue is totally disorganized and there is little advice on the floor or signage about where each line is. There are separate lines for table reservation, outdoor seating, food, drinks, bar. and so on. I believe that you can order any food or drink item from any service line, but even after my visit... I am not fully sure. There is also a lack of menus around but maybe this is intentional, to get you to impulse buy when you see pretty items on display.

2. There is a 45 minute maximum seating rule, but I spent much of this time looking for a menu, and waiting on lines for food. There were no employees in the table area to help most of the time and I was so much on my own. The menu did not show up on my Starbucks app, which advised ""no online ordering for this location"". Since there were no menus on the tables or at the reservation desk, I walked downstairs to look for one, and on the large menu board downstairs I finally found a bar code link to a menu. 

Now 5-10 minutes later...I found the reservation person and asked if I should go to the long main line to order food,  and he said yes. Next, after about 5-10 minutes on this line which barely moved, my wife motioned to me from upstairs (at 35 minutes seated and counting). She said ask if you can order the food from the bar area. I went back to the same reservation person, who said ""I think it is closed"". Apparently it wasn't as the bar people responded I could order there...

Amidst all of this confusion, I was constantly being asked to move over by security personnel, waiters, and so on... and no one offered to help...just constant warnings by everyone to move out of the way.  One time, I think I was asked to move over keep social distance... but no explanation, no apology, just ""move over to the line!""...

3. About the food:

I had a prosciutto and fotina on cornetto. A description online calls this ""slow-cooked prosciutto with fontina"". The thing that made this very dissatisfying was that this was ordinary ham (and a very mild ham at that), and not flavor rich prosciutto I was expecting. If Starbucks wants an Italian theme and calls a croissant a cornetto, well fine! But calling mild American style ham ""proscuitto"" is going too far. Even in Italy, not every type of ham is a proscuitto... I think this ""proscuitto"" would give Jordan Schlansky nightmares! The portion was also tiny, but at least that much I expected.

My wife had an almond cornetto. The cornettos are buttery and the almond cornetto had adequate almond paste inside, but it was all on one side of the pastry. These croissants are no better than at Costco, although the Starbucks cornettos are prettier.

4. Dillapidated seating: our cheap Formica table was full of large dents and scratches and should have been retired long ago... no excuse for a cafe with premium prices.

I had earlier visited the Roastery in Shanghai China, which was elegant, with beautiful tables and friendly staff all over to help.... you can see my wonderful earlier review on Tripadvisor. What a let down visiting the roastery here in New York and seeing this.","1"
"2021-03-16","It's Not Your Run-of-the-mill Starbucks","Two friends from out of town came to NYC and wanted to see me.  I told them to meet me at this Starbucks.  When they arrived they confessed to me they were quite surprised when I suggested ""Starbucks"" because ""it wasn't my style""  but upon seeing this place they quickly understood why I picked this place.  It's Starbucks on steroids and beyond.  And the pairing with Princi (if you travel to Milan you'll know this name).  I find it to be a real NYC treat.  We sat outside and our server Paul (this guy should get a pay raise, a gold star, promoted, a new car, and a house) he was beyond helpful and accommodating.  Thank you Paul -- if you read this - I know my friends weren't easy and you never got flustered or upset you just kept piling on the magic.  Thank you.  So if you're in the Meatpacking District in NYC pay a visit.  And have the food - it's excellent.","5"
"2021-01-23","Private Tour","Splurged on a private tour of the Roastery for my birthday with my daughter.  Worth every penny. Dave took us around on a VIP tour...everyone knew our name.

We were provided samples of coffee, delicious pastries and a glass of champagne at the end of our tour.  THANK YOU Dave!","5"

The decor is wide spaced, combined classy and modern with industrial style. They serve high quality coffee beans with a great variety of fresh pastries and desserts. 

However, it was so popular and crowded that we didn’t feel cozy or relaxed during our stay there. We highly recommend to visit early in the morning to avoid the crowd.","4"

"2020-03-11","pricey but good","We were visiting Chelsea market, and since Starbucks reserve is located next to it we decided to have a coffee. We had a drip coffee and a nitro cold brew; both were good, and the nitro very interesting in terms of texture, comparable to a beer, but we thought it was way too overpriced and prices also shady. We spent 15 usd and not sure because of taxes or what else but the price we thought we would be paying was way lower. We also felt quite rushed while deciding. Beans are decent, although the specialty coffee I enjoy has a lighter roast. Lots of overpriced food options too. All in all a cool experience but I would not go back","3"
"2020-03-10","Starbucks ups their game.","I wasn’t sure what Starbucks had in mind with these new reserve roasting stores, but clearly it was a bet that we’d be willing to pay more for a higher end product and experience. They were correct. Really great coffee and food here. Be prepared to spend a lot for it too. Enjoy.","5"
"2020-03-09","If Willy Wonka made coffee instead of chocolate ","Of course, there are so many great coffee shops in NY, you don't have to go far to get a great cup, but the roastery is worth seeing.

I had a long cardamom which was mediocre, $9 ish. Wife had a tea which was a pricey teabag at $8 ish. 

While waiting I took a seat at a bench and the waitress cleaning it off moved me. Then, two others just took the seat. Questionable.

If you get the (more expensive) specially coffees (as a ""flight"" of two varieties, for example) the barista will explain everything so the experience will be nice.

"2020-01-14","Three times was not nearly enough visits!","My husband and I spent five nights in NYC for New Year's. We have been to one other Starbucks Reserve in Seattle and fell in love, so we knew we had to visit this one, too! We made three trips to this location during our stay in NYC. The whole experiencing was just as wonderful as I hoped.

For the first time we tried siphoned coffee. We had a two-coffee flight (Hawaii Ka'u and Pantheon Blend), and it was so interesting to see it happening right in front of us. The barista talked us through the entire process as he made the coffee, and talked about the differences in flavor, etc., and the why behind siphoned coffee. Such a fun education.

We also tried the Whiskey Barrel-Aged Coffee. It was truly one of the best coffees we have ever had. It was unfortunately $40.00 for a small bag of it so we didn't get to bring any back to Minnesota with us. I couldn't justify that price.

The pastries were as delectable as we remembered in Seattle. Melt in your mouth and delicious. My typical drink is the ""Undertow"" espresso. I highly recommend, only wish it was bigger so it never ends. 

The staff were extremely kind, friendly, helpful, and made our visits memorable by getting in photos and taking photos of/for us. I would definitely recommend you stop in. It's beautiful inside and the smells are free!","5"

I saw things like the Cold Brew Keg that I did not know existed. Roasts I did not know existed. A Milano flat bread and salad joint on site with cast iron ovens. Full bar upstairs, but you'd better be drinking some booze or you'll get tossed, (no Starbucks hanging out up there) which is ok as there is so much to experience downstairs. I had the best Espresso con pana of my life.  The whipped cream was so fresh and cold the espresso had trouble getting around it as I tipped back the cup. The flavor is STILL memorable. As we left by the fireplace, I noticed there was a line, down the block...to get in. One recommendation: The coffee to go system needs to be studied. While there is a large waiting area for folks to pick up their to go orders, that area was so full of people it made me nervous that my order wasn't received. All was just fine it turned out, they are just dealing with the volume. Maybe a better way of letting us know Wonka's got our coffee coming?","4"

Side tip follow the instructions on how to consume the beverage to appreciate the entire process. As for the cocktails, we ordered the black & white Manhattan and the dear Lucania. Both delicious the Manhattan was really strong and the Lucana had great flavors with the honey and lemon- orange. Great place to take the family for the coffee roasting tour.

We enjoyed ourselves so much that when we were in Seattle days later, we made a point to visit the location there. It was just as impressive- however the NYC location is actually bigger. ","5"
"2019-12-06","Wonderful","This Roastery is grand. We love he wonderful selection of superior quality foods and the upstairs bar with there imaginative range of cocktails. The coffee is always lovely but we are impressed with the training program that turns out staff who are so experience, friendly and helpful. This is your typical Starbucks on Steroids and you should go out of your way to visit and marvel.","5"

"2019-11-25","Beauty, delightful products and honesty","I discovered this Starbucks reserve by chance after a lunch in Chelsea market. 
The place is awesome, with the roasting machines “en vue”. 
Products are good ( I’m Italian and with coffee always fussy. It’s the best among the Starbucks shops, this is the 3rd time I’m stopping here for a coffee.
I’m also writing this review (I written because I wanted to and not because anyone told me to do it, I’m precising), because while I was putting some milk in my coffee, I suppose that someone stole my Starbucks knit hat I paid minutes before: don’t know if it fell in the garbage bin by mistake but I remember it was far from it.  
However I spoke with (I think he is) the store manager and even if I invited him to check my bag in order to verify I was in good faith, he gave me a new item without any inspection. 
Maybe not a big deal for them, but I appreciated this attitude and I’m thanking them. ","5"
"2019-11-24","El mejor café","Starbucks Reserve Roastery es el lugar para los amantes del buen café. El lugar es muy grande porque tiene a la vista todo el proceso de tostado del café que después es servido. Vale la pena ir con tiempo para ver el funcionamiento de las máquinas y disfrutar un rico café.","5"
"2019-11-09","True hidden gem","Never was a fan of Starbucks... I hate paper cups, half-liter coffee, thousand and one flavour... I like my coffee “cortado”, or “espresso”, no sugar, no milk, no matcha tea, no madagascarian chocolate flavoured with cinnamon... Just plain black coffee. 
And in NYC you only get a paper-cupped, handful coffe... and then you walk into this place... 
One of few in the world... where thay actually roast, ground and ship coffee to the other NY Starbucks shops!
This is a must-see, and must-return place. 
Perfect blend, ceramic cup, fire-place, great service... 
Definitely look for Cesar The Poet, he really made us feel like home and wanting to come back! One of a kind place in NYC","5"
"2019-11-08","Great place! ","Great place! Really different to an normal starbucks. You can see how the cafe is being roasted. There are tables to seat, have lunch, htake a coffee some drinks , etc","5"
"2019-11-07","Sadly Disappointed","My sister and I have flown to Seattle's Starbuck's Reserve Roastery a few times just to pick up our Beloved Whiskey Barrel Aged Coffee. We were very excited to hear that there would be a Starbuck's Reserve Roastery in New York City. While there before it had opened, even drove to the spot, to dream of when we would come back to see it in ""all its glory"".
You can imagine the genuine excitement a few weeks ago when we heard they had our BELOVED coffee!! We booked the flight and we were off. Traveled the subway to the destination and....
well, no hoorah! Mind you with the Seattle one, we spent all day there and spent $100's of dollars. The difference you ask?
Yes, the same beautiful and shiny roaster machine, a nice gift area, great food from Princi, BUT and I SAY THAT LOUDLY, there are absolutely no plugs to charge or keep a computer charged. When we asked, one staff person told us it was because they didn't want people sitting around all day. I let her know they missed out on a  couple more hundred dollars we would have spent.  
Further, the staff were not friendly in comparison to Seattle. I am not that picky, being a Michigander, but the plates that were empty dishes, sat there on our table and no one walked around with a smile or cleaning up the area. There were no, Can I get something for you? or How is it going? 
I understand different culture and different comparison between the East and the West Coast, but I thought a Starbuck's was just that, a Starbuck's.
Again Princi pizza the best and the tray of meats and cheeses with crackers, jelly and the best olives ever - was great!
However, we won't go back. We'll wait for Chicago and eventually make it to London.After we make it to all of them, I'll let you know which one I think rules!","2"

"2019-10-20","Bad Taste in Mouth","So it’s nice that this Starbucks version of Disneyland can cater to the sensibilities of Mr. and Mrs. Tourist from lands far away. I get it, Starbucks needs to tap into those tourist dollars when and where they can. We all need to make a buck. But when you’re Disney, you are supposed to be the happiest place on earth. Which brings me to my one and only visit to this monstrosity of a place. Not only are those godawful wood doors impossible to open, but it’s clear that many of the staff are pretty much over dealing with the people they are supposed to serve. Case in point: There is this hapless employee standing at the entrance pouring some cold coffee concoction into tiny cups for people to try. As the people in front of me, I line up, take a cup, and hold it so he could pour me my sip. But get this—before he did, he had the audacity to say, “What? No hi or how are you?” Are you kidding me?? You, Mr. Starbucks Disney employee are the one who is supposed to greet me and make me feel welcome. That’s your one and only role. I am not there to lift your spirits. I don’t exist to make you feel better about your job. If you don’t like serving the people, get another job. Count me as one less Starbucks Reserve patron.","1"

to get food & hot & cold drinks, three menus, a fireplace, a taste of the bourbon barrel aged cold brew as you walk in.  
A tasteful mix of metal, upholstered chairs with small modern wooden tables.  It was packed, so we were advised to try the lower level for a more complete experience.  For my latte I got to choose from 2 featured expressos. That never happened before!  We also had some wonderful cannolis. 
If you’re in NYC, you’ve GOT to go!!","5"
"2019-10-13","Too much is sometime overkill","I had high hope's but if you only visiting here to pick up a cup of coffee or grab a sandwich don't expect to find an easy solution that's very complicated and more dedicated to the people who are staying at the Roasterie for a significant of time. Grab and go was very difficult. The location is very well done and well-crafted but seems to only dedicate itself towards that high upper class.","3"
"2019-10-13","Coffee and Consumer Experience ","Amazing new place for Starbucks focused more on the incredible design maybe more than the user experience. Food poor variety but really great tasting. Coffee as always. Good but not excellent.

"2019-10-13","Not your normal Starbucks","I'm going quite frequently to Starbucks when in the US as some kind of default choice when i'm not aware of better alternatives in the vicinity. I stumbled of this one after being at Chelsea Market. Optically it's a highlight. You should visit it at least once, the Chai Latte seems to  much better than the one at regular one (but perhaps they prepare it differently). Really liked it. However it's significantly more expensive and for your morning caffeine dose a normal Starbucks is sufficient.","4"

Un amplísimo salón, donde entran alrededor de 600 personas.

Una zona industrial, con sus máquinas para preparación del café, dan un toque especial a todo el entorno comercial.

The atmosphere has a really cool vibe, great merchandise and even a bar serving coffee-centric cocktails.  Wanted to come back to try the cocktails, but just ran out of time in NYC.  Great place to start before walking through Chelsea Market.  Or pop into the other Starbucks Reserve Roasteries if you're in Seattle, Shanghai, or Milan.","5"
"2019-09-17","Overpriced","As instalações são maravilhosas. Não lembram um Starbucks, mesmo porque tem lanches, pizzas, saladas e sobremesas em ilhas diferentes. Cada artigo deve ser pago em sua estação. Os funcionários são bastante simpáticos. Tem até uma área com serviço de mesas. A comida é boa, sanduíches e sobremesas, mas o preço é realmente muito mais alto que locais parecidos, mesmo os mais badalados, tipo Eataly. Vale a pena visitar, mas não é um local recorrente, pois um expresso a U$ 5,00 e um cheese cake, metade do Cheesecake factory, por U$ 10,00 é realmente para turistas. Lembre-se sempre que isso é um Starbucks.","4"

"2019-09-01","Enorme local ","El local es uno de los más grandes de la cadena en lo que reside su atractivo, pero nada más. Los productos son los comunes que se sirven en todo el mundo. La diferencia está en las dimensiones de la tienda y en el hecho de que es muy concurrido. Cuando fui había tanta gente que las filas eran interminables. Esto es un punto en contra. Es algo para tener en cuenta. La atención diligente también hace al valor de la tienda, ya que implica tener respeto por sus clientes, entre otras cosas también importantes. ","3"

The middle level (where you enter) has a bakery area, a coffee and drinks area, and a tasting area. There’s free samples going around of unique items - I had cold brew that was aged in rum barrels - it was delicious! Pretty much all Starbucks products are available for purchase here. The lower floor has a fancy brewing area where they walk you through the roasting of the beans, you can actually see the machinery. The upper floor has a super fancy bar area with unique drinks as well. Staff are all friendly and professional. It’s a great experience and definitely worth a visit. ","5"

"2019-08-16","This is a Starbucks emporium. If you love the brand, you’ll love this place","This Starbucks reserve occupies a corner of the very same building where you’ll find the Apple Store. It’s similarly super cool, high end, modern, crowded and pricey with a lot of different interesting products and very good service. They roast their own special beans here. The coffee is superior to the normal Starbucks experience but you definitely pay the price differential. I went to order a triple espresso over ice which is my normal Starbucks order but it was $7.50 here more than double what you would normally pay. So you only come here for the really superior Starbucks coffee product and all the various good food options. It’s a very cool venue with multiple levels and lots of people coming and going. Definitely touristy but super fun. ","4"

"2019-08-04","Could spend HOURS here, awesome staff and experience, must visit ... really","The purpose of our trip was to visit Chelsea Market ... HOWEVER we noticed the Starbucks Reserve right across the street and went in for a quick minute. This ended up being the highlight of our trip to the Chelsea Market area. The staff are amazing and very hospitable. We had several interactions that just showed how focused they are on ensuring everyone is treated like a guest, but just an everyday customer. 

There are three (3) levels of adventure. The top floor has oven fired pizza, coffee roasting demonstrations, and unique gifts. The middle level is a tasting experience, kind of like a sommolier. The lower level are ... bathrooms! The bathrooms are Euro-style, open to everyone and with a common hand washing area. Other restaurants need to begin taking this approach in the city. You can also peek behind the stairs into the lower roasting area (kind of fun).

Don’t miss this experience. This is NOT the same as the Starbucks Reserve by Times Square - that one is just “in name only,” and doesn’t offer the breadth of experience that this location does.

Oh yeah, and then there’s Chelsea Market.","5"
"2019-07-31","Woooooooow","This is such an amazing place. Great food and such an amazing variety of coffee etc. The service is outstanding, friendly and i love the merchandise. 

If you go there try the espresso affogato and the „whiskey“ coffee. It’s from whiskey barrels but its alcohol free, but the taste is extraordinary!

Best breakfast place! Yes its not cheap but compared to other expensive places (new york is pricey) its worth it!!!","5"

"2019-07-21","Such a unique experience","If you like Starbucks or coffee at all this is a great place to see! I have never been to any other Starbucks Roastery so I don’t have anything to compare it to, but it was so worth it to visit while we were in town that we went multiple times and it wasn’t super close. The whiskey cold brew was amazing! The nitro mocha tasted like a caffeinated chocolate milk, which was awesome. I also tried the cold brew rum drink at the bar upstairs which was a perfectly balanced cocktail. The roasters walked us through the whole roasting process and taught us so much. This was a really fun experience and a great way to stay cool on a few hot days. I’d recommend going early in the morning on a weekday if you want the least crowded experience. ","5"

"2019-07-06","Great place","Wow what a surprise,  having never been in a Starbucks nor tasted any of their coffees before this place was something else.  Lots of merchandise to do with their theme and brand, not only did we buy some cups and coffee beans but this is an amazing place to eat,  huge selection you won’t be able to choose, allow plenty of time.","5"
"2019-07-05","So worth it!! ","We visited NYC and debated on taking the long walk to go to the Starbucks Reserve.... so glad we did. Such an amazing place. Best coffee I have tasted 
 ","5"
"2019-07-03","Great, but Expensive","What a place.  The coffee is excellent.  The Princi Bakery is amazing.  The food is fantastic.  No regular Starbucks products like Frappachino.  It’s not cheap, but a nice treat to spoil yourself.","5"
"2019-07-02","굿!","매장이 굉장히 크고 다양한 원두가 있어서 보기만 해도 맛있는 커피를 먹을 수 있을 것만 같았습니다. 자리를 잡고 라테를 먹었는데 진짜 맛있었습니다. 다른 매장에서 먹는것과 다른 느낌이었습니다. 굿! 인테리어 좋음!","4"
"2019-07-02","Starbucks Reserve Spettacolare ","Ottimo Starbucks Reserve: prima colazione (cappuccino e cornetto) buonissima. Per chi ama finalmente un buon caffè all’italiana, in questo luogo lo trovi! Anche per quanto riguarda il cibo salato, ottime pizze e insalate di paste fredde. Insomma un posto assolutamente da visitare in Chelsea.","5"

"2019-06-23","Unique ","We stopped in for an iced type coffee after lunch at a place down the street.  The place was bustling and had a large selection of various unique coffees, teas, cocktails, pizza and bakery items both sweet and savory. Our nitro mocha iced drinks were very good. We also shared a raspberry jelly filled croissant. You have to go when in the area.  ","5"
"2019-06-20","What an experience","Great sandwiches and good tea. Quite an expansion of Starbucks. They roast their own coffee there and even have interpreters to explain the process and what all the parts of that huge roaster are doing. If you haven't been in one yet, it is fun to explore and watch the sandwich makers.","5"
"2019-06-19","You though Nespresso was pretentious","Pretentious: sums up the experience. However, I must conceive that I’m a sucker for upmarket coffee and am willing to divulge in more expensive beverages. The variety of beans is greater here however the options of drinks is better in normal starbucks ","3"

"2019-06-13","Beautiful place but....","This review is reflected of  my two visits to Starbucks Reserve over the past few months.  I a long supporter of Starbucks, I probably get there coffee 5-6 times a week.  When I travel overseas I always go to Starbucks because of their consistency. I was a little excited  to see a Starbucks Reserve and happy one was near me when I stay in NYC.  First the place is beautiful, spared no expense. The staff is equally excellent. Unfortunately that where it ends. The place is so overly complicated when you try to get a drip coffee, order a sandwich or try a buy something. My first visit all I wanted was a drip coffee, I realized one has to wait  long time for a drip. You order it then you have to go to the other side of the large counter and then wait what seemed like 10 minutes, but was more like 5-6.  I finally asked a nice gentleman and he said someone would call when name when the drink is ready. I returned again a month later and this time I wanted to buy some gifts. After a nice man assisted me I waited at the same counter to be charged. The total was about $80, after I paid I realized I wanted to use my Starbucks card to get the reward points. I asked if I could and he replied he would need to get a supervisor. After no one arrived to help, I asked the man if some e was coming and he said, he’d ask again. Which he did.  After waiting a real 10 minutes- no one arrived, so I left.
The place is so beautiful with amazing unique things to purchase and appealing food for purchase. The process just seem a so overly complicated I can’t appreciate it.","2"
"2019-06-11","Pretentious moi?  Oh my god......","If apple did Starbucks this might be close.  Over hyped, security on the door, took 15 minutes to get a tea and then over $6.......OMG","3"
"2019-06-11","Wow","Finally!
 Excellent coffee in NY!
 What an experience, what a service, what a coffee, the cakes are wonderful.
Loved it","5"
"2019-06-11","The coffee mecca for NYC","This new store is a sight to behold. I'm not a coffee drinker unlike my wife, but what an amazing sight inside. Firstly the place is huge over 2 levels and schmick. The staff are dressed in wonderful attire, there are various sections including a bar, a bakery, a coffee bar and other amazing areas. Even an actual roasting zone where staff roast the coffee in elaborate machines akin to something out of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Definitely a place to visit even if you're not into coffee.","4"
"2019-06-06","Must see place! ","It’s a huge starbucks with very fancy decoration and including interesting coffee machines. Very nice place to taste different coffee types. I recommend the ice cream with the espresso which is a very different taste experience. ","5"
"2019-06-05","El único Starbucks con buen café!","El lugar es muy hermoso, mucho cobre y una iluminación que resalta los detalles de decoración. En general no me gusta el café de Starbucks -sólo pido chai latte- pero en este el café es realmente bueno. El baguetín de mortadela con pistachos fresquísimo y delicioso. Más caro que los comunes, eso sí.","4"
"2019-06-01","Mejor cafe en lindo lugar","Excelente café , recién inaugurado , mejores sandwich , espacios cómodos , un lugar   muy lindo, bien decorado de excelente gusto ... vale 100% la pena conocer antes de recorrer high line... o después...lo recomiendo","5"
"2019-05-28","Starbucks Reserve Roastery","Cool one-time experience for me. I am a big coffee fan so enjoyed viewing the various brewing methods and displays. The coffee was good and the desserts were excellent. Would definitely recommend.","4"
"2019-05-28","Great place!","There are 2 floors with rare coffees and a lot of food choices regular Starbucks do not have. Pizzas, salads, baked goods and coffee bars on both levels. There is a whiskey barrel coffee that is out of this world! There were free samples when I was there. Neat place to see.","5"
"2019-05-17","One of a kind coffee shop","We came here thinking let’s have some coffee, but on wow! This is not your normal coffee place. You have to try the whisky barrel-aged ice coffee is hits you with a cool ice sweetness. It smelt like whisky but it is coffee. ","5"

"2019-05-15","What a place!","We happened to see this Starbucks while walking by and immediately went in to see what it was all about.  Wow!  They are roasting coffee right on site and visitors are able to see the process happening right in front of them.  

The equipment is very elegant looking, the place is huge and the whole experience was amazing!","4"
"2019-05-15","Para fanáticos de Starbucks","Normalmente no voy a Starbucks porque no tomo café, pero creo que es un lugar que vale la pena conocer, especialmente para los fanáticos de la marca.

En pleno barrio de Chelsea, y al costado de una tienda de Apple, está este impresionante café. Es muy grande, con muchos ambientes, barras de café, bar, panadería, tostaduría de café, tienda...

Está lleno de pequeños detalles: madera, metal, cuero en los pasamanos, iluminación, chimenea...Más que el café (habitual de Starbucks), me parecieron muy buenos los sandwiches y pizzas de la panadería.

El baño está buenísimo también.

Vale la pena hacer una pausa en el recorrido de la ciudad en este lugar.","4"
"2019-05-08","Amazing store","Came in as soon as I heard they opened a location in the meatpacking district. The store is huge. It’s like the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory of coffee. They also have a bar on the second level where you can grab a cocktail. You won’t regret visiting. It’s a must see.","5"
"2019-05-07","Quite impressed","Warm ambiance, wide open floor plan 3 stories. Serving special coffee beans from all over the world that differs from regular stores. Sandwiched between Apple store and Chelsea Market this place welcomes you into specialty coffee with croissant sandwich spreads to bake goods, and they added sweet slices of cakes. Enjoy plenty of seating with friends to relax over specially roasted beans customized to go or to stay. 
Served rather quickly, unsure when its packed. I went on a Monday late afternoon around 3pm-4pm with plenty of seating.  
Expect to spend more $ here than typical Starbucks coffee stores. Barista said due to special brewing machines and selected beans.","5"
"2019-04-30","Optisch ein Highlight aber insgesamt viel zu überteuert","Wir waren 2x dort weil das Ambiente schön ist und der Laden einen Besuch wert ist.
Jedoch muss ich sagen, dass die Preise dort im Vergleich zu einem normalen Starbucks in NYC 4x so hoch sind.
Die Preise sind doppelt so hoch und die Portionen nur die Hälfte. 
Vom Style um Ambiente ist die Roastery natürlich der Hammer.
Alleine wir die Gebäckteilchen angerichtet werden ist ein Traum. Diese sehen auch super aus. Es ist schon sehr durchgestylt und auf jeden Fall einen besuch wert. Es duftet auch herrlich dort weil direkt dort geröstet wird. 
Leider war mein Tee gar nicht lecker und ich habe diesen schließlich reklamiert und zurück gegeben. Die Mitarbeiter waren sehr bemüht und blieben stets freundlich.
Der Kaffee den mein Mann hatte, war auch nur ""Durchscnitt"" wie er sagte. Er hat schon bessere getrunken....
Ist halt typisch NYC: Mehr Schein als Sein","2"
"2019-04-30","Un starbucks digne de sa démesure !","Sortis de Chelsea market nous tombons sur ce Starbucks, nous n'en avions jamais croisé un d'aussi grand espace.

"2019-04-24","Tolles Ambiente - aber sehr sehr teuer!","Wir haben diesen exklusiven Starbucks per Zufall gefunden, wir waren vorher im Chelsea Market und es ist gleich gegenüber. Ein wirklich schönes Ambiente, spektakulär die riesige Rösterei. Sehr schöne Einrichtung und sehr freundliches Personal - natürlich sehr guter Kaffee ;-)
Aber mal ganz ehrlich, 10USD für ein Stück Kuchen?? Zu dritt haben wir sehr schnell über 50USD ausgegeben. Also ja, tolles Ambiente und alles sehr schön, aber hier wird einfach zu sehr hingelangt bei den Preisen.
Aber na ja, wer eine kleine Pause einlegen möchte in einer schönen Kaffee-Bar ist hier richtig. Dennoch eine Empfehlung an die Betreiber: Es ist klar dass dies eines eurer Flagstores ist, aber bitte überdenkt Eure Preise.","4"
"2019-04-23","Cool place, nice Italian touch to Starbucks, but...","I got to say 30 USD for 2 caffè affogato and a croissant... and 20 minutes wait... is too much! If  the experience is what they want to sell (and coffee and t-shirts and mugs and ...) they got to improve on speed and service.

"2019-04-19","Excellent coffee & snacks, awesome BATHROOMS!!","When you're walking all over the city, eating and drinking excellent food and drink you often find yourself needing a restroom- sometimes hard to find or they're small and dirty. Enter Starbucks Reserve restrooms located on the bottom floor. AMAZING! Don't misunderstand- this is also a review for their great service and delicious caffeine but if you have an appreciation for a nice bathroom like me then please check it out. You'll thank me later!","5"
"2019-04-19","What a Find!!","Found this as we exited Chelsea Market, and wow, I was in Starbucks heaven... just amazing inside and awesome coffees and setup. Had to buy some merch from this place as it is the only one in the world!","5"
"2019-04-17","Forse ero ubriaca","Non so ancora come mi sia venuto in mente di spendere 19 dollari in quello che era un frappuccino di un normale Starbucks ma servito in un bicchiere diverso.
Il posto é anche carino da vedere, ma considerato che c’è il Chelsea marker dietro l’angolo e i prezzi non vale proprio la pena.","2"
"2019-04-13","Starbucks at it's best","We found the reserve by accident and what a find it was. As a Starbucks lover I was in heaven. Excellent selection of coffees. I got the perfect latte here.

"2019-03-30","Hipster to the second power ","Its cool. Trendy and probably the place to be. 
It does have 3 levels of all Starbucks coffee, bar, food, and Ofcourse the roastery. 
Main level is pretty big. With huge coffee bars, and tasty displays of pastries. 
Barrista everywhere in a unique uniform. Staff is friendly and answer any questions you have about the roastery. 
This location does not have the traditional menu, so be prepared to order something similar, but not quite the same as for example a typical/traditional or may i dare say a staple of Starbucks... a caramel macchiato. 
Plenty of choices tho, so you will find something for everyone in party.","4"
"2019-03-29","Another version of Starbucks ","It has been talk of the town since its grand opening so I decided to check it out. It’s a very exciting moment. There’re beans that coming out of the giant copper roastery in the center of the hall, then floating around the ceiling. 

There are three levels separating three main zones; main bar, experience bar, and arriviamo bar. 

I tried the  “shakerato affogato” at the main bar. It’s delicious and smooth just like gelato blends with frappe. 

Then, I moved to arriviamo bar to try their cocktail. They serve a flatbread while I was waiting for my starbucks’ negroni “nocino notte” as a complimentary. It has cold brew, gin, bitter, don ciccio & figli nocino, and black traffle salt. I couldn’t taste the cold brew but it’s a one fine drink if you love negroni. 

I think it will be a top destination for the tourists pretty soon so you should come here when it’s still fresh to explore!!!","5"
"2019-03-24","Nice cup of joe and then some. ","We stopped in after dinner for coffee and dessert.  We had never been here before and the place was quite impressive.  There was coffee, there was a bar, there was pizza and there was desserts.  Not your typical Starbucks. They had different varieties of coffees not offered at regular Starbucks.  They roast there own beans there too.  Plenty of places to sit and hang out.  ","5"
"2019-03-20","Not your average Starbucks ","Must see for Starbuck fans and all coffee lovers in general...Three levels with full service bar,  on site bakery,  and coffee beans processed and then moved by many clear tubes along ceiling.....
Little pricey ( $10 for a piece of cake)....I expected a larger merchandise section , but not the case...Again , right now there is only three of these types of Starbucks in the world,  with only 2 more planned...If you are visiting the south end of the Highline,  Chelsea Market or near 14th street on the Westside then stop by...","3"
"2019-03-18","The Pinnacle of Coffee shops","WOW!!  I was blown away by the size, design, layout, options, menu, customer service, etc. Definitely an experience!! My family and I enjoyed leisurely relaxing while enjoying our beverages and pastries—both surpassing expectations. My one negative comment, with all the great merchandise and clothing options they don’t sell XXL T-shirts. The merchandise manager’s explanation that “the company Starbucks partners with to make the clothing doesn’t do XXL” seems like a poor excuse for a practice that discriminates against a segment of their customer base.","4"

"2019-03-10","Really cool place ","Had never heard of the reserve roasteries before but stumbled on this after this high line. Tried something from the menu of different coffee drinks - hazelnut milk latte - so good! Really friendly and helpful staff too. Definitely try it if in the area.","4"
"2019-03-08","A verdadeira Starbucks boutique","Se você gosta de Starbucks, vai adorar esse lugar. Fica na frente do Chelsea Market e o local é bem grande. Tem uma cafeteria com comidinhas, café em grãos de origens seletas, vários produtos exclusivos como xícaras, camisetas e outras coisas. A decoração é de altíssimo bom gosto.

Su decoración colonial, los colores negro y bronce de las cafeteras, las maravillosas tazas color negro, los diferentes ambientes de bar, panadería, cafetería, el maravilloso y amplio desarrollo de producto de merchandising que han hecho...y ver el proceso desde que se selecciona el grano de café, ver cómo se tuesta, disfrutar del olor del café en todo el proceso... una experiencia única!!! Eso sí...si te tomas un expreso prepara 5$...o si prefieres un grande latte, prepara 8$!! Es caro, pero ya que estás allí hay que completar la experiencia😉! Espectacular el lugar y ver Starbucks a otro nivel👏👏","5"
"2019-02-23","Totally amazing ","We stumbled across this place and were so glad we did. It is a total transformation of the traditional Starbucks . So much so it does not feel like Starbucks. Yes you can have a coffee and pastry as usual but even the seating area is different. It has a really relaxed vibe as well as a huge shop where you can purchase the natal mug, but so so much more. If you need bar ware, or a $5,000 ornament this is the place for you. Brilliant. ","5"
"2019-02-20","Maravilhosa","Enorme, lindíssima, funcionários super atenciosos, comidas maravilhosas e deliciosas.

"2019-02-12","AMAZING!!!! A must-do while in the area!","I’m a huge Starbucks fan, so when the Roastery finally opened, I had to go.  The place is physically breathtaking.  The attention to detail when designing the space is impressive! That aside, there’s something for everyone here. Food, Full service bar with brilliant craft cocktails (some with coffee), and of course coffee made a million different ways.  Yes you’ll pay a little more for a latte, but what would you expect?! It’s not your basic Starbucks. This place is an experience and in NYC - you get what you pay for. ...don’t like paying $6 for a latte??,  then go to a coffee shop.  This is not that. I now bring all of my clients here because its a lovely time and I don’t care that I can’t use my rewards because that’s just silly. The place with dazzle the eyes, belly, and palate.","5"
"2019-02-09","Terrible experience","I visited this cafe on my last trip to New York - huge mistake. Although it is obvious that a good amount of money has been spent to set up the place, is seems like they haven’t spent much time and money for staff training. 

When I went to the counter to make an order, there was no menu on the wall so I had to ask one of the staffs how to order. He gave me a menu without any explanation, and while I was standing there to study the menu for a while, he didn’t offer any help. I finally ordered a cup of coffee and was told to go to the other side to pick up. So I waited for like 10 minutes. At first I thought there must have been a lot of orders before me but then I noticed some people came after me got their order. I asked one of the staffs behind the bar, and she was looking at the order papers and told me my coffee will be ready soon. So I waited another 5 minutes - still no coffee. I asked again, this time one of the baristas, and he seemed to check something and went back to the machine, without saying anythhing to me. I wasn’t sure what was going on so went to him and asked, then he said “I’m making your coffee now.”, without a hint of apology. So I asked what happened to my ordered and he said, very casually, “someone must’ve taken it”. I couldn’t believe how unprofessional and even rude he was, at the place which is supposed to be all about amazing coffee experience, as Starbucks promotes. I complained to another staff and she called the manager, who took care of it with a professional manner. But still, I had to waste my time and energy during my trip for such unpleasant matter, which was totally unnecessary.

I don’t think I would ever go back to this location, or any other Starbucks reserve cafe. Also I don’t recommend visiting here to anyone, especially travellers, as I don’t want anyone else to have such unpleasant memory during their trip to New York. Plus it’s extremely overpriced - small cup of coffee for $5-6, and it’s not worth the price (mine was served in a cold cup which dropped the temperature too much- yes, they don’t care about the details). New York has a lot of other great coffee shops which offer better cups at lower price, with a better service. So please, stay away from this cafe.","1"
"2019-02-07","Crowded overpriced Disneycoffeeland, with $5.99 lattes","Great place to walk in and walk around and then leave. The food looks great, the coffee selection seems exciting, and then you realize everything costs a fortune just as at Disneyland. Maybe your best bet is to head to the upstairs bar since the alochol won't cost much more than the ridiculously overpriced $5.99 latte did. Oh but the beans are so special, you might say. Well I've been to coffee estates in Colombia and Rwanda and honestly no latte anywhere is worth $5.99. But if you consider the payment to be for temporarily renting the space then it's money well spent. Service was nice if a bit chaotic and very hectic. ","3"
"2019-02-05","Incrível ","Cafeteria conceito gigante da Starbucks. Tem vários ambientes, padaria, confeitaria, drinks e muitos tipos de cafés. Ali tem torrefação e moagem dos grãos e uma pessoa fica explicando como funciona. Muito bacana, dá para passar horas ali.","5"
"2019-01-30","Great Starbucks Experience","Definitely not your typical Starbucks. The Roastery is the main attraction, not to be missed. Aside from the usual coffee's, The Stabucks Reserve offers wonderful mastery by the mixologists. A must is their Affogato, 2 shots of espresso over locally made ice cream.","5"
"2019-01-28","Fun touristy experience, greatvstaff","We accidentally wound up in front of Starbucks reserve and decided to stop in. We had heard about the larger one opening in Milan last trip to Italy but did not get there so wanted to try it here.
The staff are exceptional, friendly, informative. We had drinks at the bar that were perfect. Snacked on a sausage , broccoli rabe focaccia pizza, bought some fabulous extra dark coffee to bring home and even bought the cocktail glasses to enjoy at home. 
I did not understand before how starbucks could be successful in Italy where you get the best coffee, but the Reserve is an experience and a lot of fun, watching them roast the reserve beans and sipping perfectly crafted cocktails.  It is coffee’s version of Eataly.","5"

"2019-01-23","Overall, fantastic but comes with a huge downfall!","First off, the ambiance and atmosphere is fantastic! Very vibrant..It doesn't even feel like a Starbucks! The service is friendly and knowledgable. Starbucks did a great job with this location. They are actively roasting coffee on site and lots of bustling activity is going on. They have a great assortment of food and pastries on a higher scale than your average Starbucks. My Vietman clover brewed coffee was delicious and well-prepared.
So why only 2 stars? You can't redeem Starbucks rewards. I was shocked. That's outrageous since we earned those rewards and it is a Starbucks corporate store. Also, I can redeem rewards at any other Starbucks reserve location for a clover brewed coffee. I think it's a disservice to good customers that you can't redeem rewards at this store all because it's a bit fancier than your average Starbucks. I doubt I will return unless Starbucks changes their policy and allows dedicated good customers use their rewards.","2"
"2019-01-23","Not your daily coffee. For the experience yes but not again.","I strongly recommend to visit the place if your nearby for the experience. It was expensive check the menu if you want to eat there ahead of time. I suggest to eat at Chelsea Market next door plenty of food halls and different choices of food then you can have coffee Starbucks reserve $$$ even some alcoholic drinks infused with coffee???$","2"
"2019-01-17","Starbucks own Willy Wonka coffee factiry","Impressive from the first encounter with big wooden doors that prepare you for a momentous legendary coffee experience. Includes a complete massive roasting system with beans pulled through transparent pipes into and out of the toaster.  Several different levels of food service from table service, to full backers and pizzeria, to upstairs coffee and alcohol bar.  Starbucks specialty shop items and also a whole section for coffee bean purchases.  We had to try the large cold press “Nitro Brew” - looked like a stout dark beer and provided a very smooth and enjoyable drink.  Sampled bakery products with the coffee (and a red wine) in comfortable casual table settings next to the upstairs bar, with a nice view of the roasting operation.","5"

"2019-01-15","Unique Experience for Coffe Enthusiasts","I was taken a back upon entry into this Starbucks Reserve Roastery. It tripled as a cafe, bar and roasting plant.  What pleased me most was how friendly the entire staff was. Unfortunately no Venti size served here.","5"
"2019-01-15","Huge Starbucks Fan!","So there are a few other locations in New York but this is the largest Starbucks Reserve Roastery in NYC. I’m a huge fan of Starbucks, I have the app and everything. The cocktails at the bar range in price and take some time to create but the wait is worth it and the drinks are worth it. Not into alcohol? You can get spirit free drinks with you friends after work as well! There’s a huge coffee bean pit where someone who is knowledgeable in coffee beans is there to answer your questions. My favorite spot is by the fireplace because it’s super cozy, I would recommend coming to visit especially if you’re in the area. They have fresh foods and a much high end coffee and tea selections. New York was a great location for this reserve. Lastly, they do have bathrooms that are located downstairs and they are unisex fully available and does not require a code to get in!

"2019-01-13","Coffee experience","First and foremost this is not your average Starbucks. 

Don’t come in if you are planning to get your usual latte. 

Explore what this Starbucks is all about. 

We had the experience with the Chemex brewing method with there original coffee been, with a chocolate tarts. 

View it as a coffee experience for your pallets, explore it and let yourself guide by there Roastery master. 

We were lucky that it was a slow Monday night and we had a chance to talk to the staff and get to know the concept and all. 

we chatted with Dennis, while enjoying our delicious coffee, great character","5"

Si può seguire la sequenza della lavorazione del caffè da quando viene raccolto nei campi ( con video proiettati ) a quando viene trasportato nei sacchi che si possono vedere mentre scorrono sollevati da apposite catene mobile, fino a tutto il processo di lavorazione fino ad arrivare ai chicchi ancora caldi che l’addetto non mancherà di offrivi ancora caldi  sulle mani mentre venite rapiti dal sapore ineguagliabile della qualità arabica. Il caffè servito al bar è uno dei pochi che vale la pena di bere a NYC. A Milano da qualche mese è aperto il suo clone che riscuote altrettanto successo in un posto bellissimo ","5"
"2019-01-08","Cool for Starbucks Lovers","We came here by accident from the Chelsea Markets, we are Australian, so Starbucks isn't really the kind of coffee we drink. The store is impressive to look at, there are 3 floors, which is really more like 2.5. It is cool to see the roasting and there are plenty of choices for which coffee you would like. There is also food to buy. Apparently, a worker said it gets very busy between 11 and 3. We were there around 10 and it was pretty empty.","3"
"2019-01-06","Coffee lovers heaven ","We stumbled upon this mega-Starbucks next to Chelsea market.  Friendly service and multiple types of coffee roasting/brewing.   Great food choices and an enticing shop also ","5"
"2019-01-03","Utter madness!","Do not queue for this Starbucks - if you're in desperate need for a coffee, turn around and visit the smaller Starbucks on the corner of 15th and 9th.  It really isn't worth the wait.

We were staying in the area, so were able to visit early one morning before the queuing started.  Once the coffee was ordered (from the very miserable member of staff on the till, we then waited about 8-10 minutes for our coffees to be made.  There was plenty of seating available downstairs where we sat and proceed to have a distinctly average latte and mocha.  Admittedly, the Princi Bakery pastries were very tasty, but we had spent $28 dollars on this and it really wasn't worth it.  

There is a novelty factor and plenty of merchandise for Starbucks fans, but I wouldn't go back.","2"
"2018-12-30","A Starbucks lovers paradise","My husband and I stumbled onto the new Starbucks Roastery. It's 3 floors of coffee lovers paradise. The offer pizza, a full bar, flights of coffee. The pastries look amazing. There is of course, a lots of Starbucks swag to buy. I got a cold brew float. My husband got a the drinking hot chocolate. Both drinks were tasty. We went on a Saturday night and the place was packed. The prices are high than a regular Starbucks. Both drinks cost us $17 so be prepared. ","4"
"2018-12-27","Very nice place, subpar service ","The architecture, ambiance and decor is very nice but the service is subpar. There are four places at which you can order but you cannot buy the available items everywhere. As a result, if you want to have a capuchino with a piece of panettone, you have to wait two times at queue (while your drink goes cold). If you want a sandwich, you have to go to a separate counter, etc. 

Starbucks has been synonymous of excellent quality and convenience. This place feels more “sophisticated” but it is not a match in service to the “regular” Starbucks across the street ","2"
"2018-12-26","Great breakfast! Princi pastries and Starbucks Reserve coffee!","My second time to one of these and I just love it!
The pastries are really delicious and so is the coffee!!
You will thank me later ;)","5"
"2018-12-19","The Holy Grail of Coffee Shops","When I read that the Roastery opening would coincide with my trip to NYC I was extremely excited. Conveniently located in Chelsea, this place delivered more than it promised ! I got a drink at the bar, looking down on the roasting of tons of beans. Two large coffee bars and a bakery complete the options for food and drink. The retail area was filled with exclusive Starbucks Reserve roastery products that I happily bought! I am still happily content with my visit and can't wait to visit again!. ","5"
